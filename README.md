# ESportsReaders

The idea behind this project is to make an project MFE with module federation. So, we desided to address the topic of esports, but only with focus in showing the results of games and show the schedules of tournaments around the world.

Firstly, the idea of this repository is to be just a host project, we'll create other repositories with focus on a specific game.
